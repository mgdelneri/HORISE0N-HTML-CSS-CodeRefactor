# Horiseon Website Refactoring

In this project, I looked at and refactored existing code for a website developed for Horiseon. I was given the HTML and CSS files for this website:

The goal of the project was to refactor this code in order to make it more accessible, which would, in turn, improve its search engine optimization. 

First, I changed the code in order to improve organization: improving HTML and CSS semantics, making sure the code followed a logical order, and consolidating code in CSS. 

In order to improve accessibility and SEO, I changed the title element to better describe the function of the webpage; I added the alt attribute where applicable; I added descriptive titles to links and background image; I fixed a link that was not working; I added media query to improve responsive design.

My initial difficulties had to do with using and mastering git. The more I researched, asked about, and practiced git, the more I started understanding it, and eventually it became easier. I still would have rather committed more often in the first few days of the project. 

I also encountered difficulty with elements of responsive design and, in particular, media queries. I had some success, but I intend on researching and practicing this more. Because of this difficulty, only the header of the webpage has responsively-designed elements so far, so it will need more work. 

In the process of refactoring this webpage, I have also realized that the work or project is never completely finished. There always seems to be a way to improve code and the design of a webpage. With that in mind, I am sending what I consider to be a good example of what I, someone that is very new to coding, could do in the time allotted. I intend to continue immersing myself in this field and building on my knowledge and experience. 

The resulting webpage looks like the original, but with improved features.
