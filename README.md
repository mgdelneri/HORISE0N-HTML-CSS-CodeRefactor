# Horiseon Website Refactoring

In this project, I looked at and refactored existing code for a website developed for Horiseon. I was given the HTML and CSS files for this website:

The goal of the project was to refactor this code in order to make it more accessible, which would, in turn, improve its search engine optimization. 

First, I changed the code in order to improve organization: improving HTML and CSS semantics, making sure the code followed a logical order, and consolidating code in CSS. 

In order to improve accessibility and SEO, I:
-changed the title element to better describe the function of the weboage;
-added the alt attribute where applicable;
-added descriptive titles to links and background image;
-fixed a link that was not working.

The resulting webpage looks like the original, but with improved features.
